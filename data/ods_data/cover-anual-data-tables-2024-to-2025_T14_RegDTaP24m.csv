[note 1],"In 2009 to 2010, 4 primary care trusts (PCTs) reported data quality issues associated with child health information systems.",,,,,,,,,,
[note 2],"In 2010 to 2011, 10 PCTs identified data quality issues, 6 of which were associated with the implementation of child health information systems. In addition, 3 PCTs reported only partial data for their area and a further one reported figures that were estimates.",,,,,,,,,,
[note 3],"In 2011 to 2012, 4 PCTs identified data quality issues. ",,,,,,,,,,
[note 4],"In 2012 to 2013, 4 PCTs identified data quality issues. ",,,,,,,,,,
[note 5],"In 2013 to 2014, data quality issues were reported in relation to data for 8 local authorities.",,,,,,,,,,
[note 6],"In 2014 to 2015, CHIS system problems were reported in relation to 2 local authorities.",,,,,,,,,,
[note 7],"In 2015 to 2016, national figures contain a mixture of estimated local authority data and submitted local authority data",,,,,,,,,,
[note 9],"The DTaP/IPV/Hib (5-in-1) vaccine was replaced by the DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB (6-in-1) vaccine in August 2017. Therefore the following age cohorts will have received either the 5-in-1 or the 6-in-1 vaccination, depending on when in the year they were vaccinated: 12 month age cohort in 2018-19 (born in 2017 to 2018), the 24 month age cohort in 2019 to 2020 (born in 2017 to 2018), and the 5-year month age cohort in 2022 to 2023 (born in 2017 to 2018).",,,,,,,,,,
[note 13],"In 2005 to 2006, 9 PCTs were unable to submit data due to problems relating to the implementation of a new child health system. ",,,,,,,,,,
[note 14],"In 2006 to 2007, 7 PCTs were unable to submit data due to problems relating to the implementation of a new child health system.",,,,,,,,,,
[note 15],"In 2007 to 2008, 6 PCTs were unable to submit data due to problems relating to the implementation of a new child health system.",,,,,,,,,,
[note 16],"In 2008 to 2009, 18 trusts reported data quality issues. Thirteen of these were directly attributable to the introduction of new child health systems. One PCT submitted partial datasets due to the unavailability of data from certain parts of the PCT and a further 3 PCTs submitted data based upon quarterly data due to problems reporting an annual figure.",,,,,,,,,,
[note 17],Regional figures for the South East for 2012 to 2013 and earlier have been aggregated from data submitted for the South East Coast and South Central Strategic Health Authorities (SHA) which shared very similar geographical boundaries to the South East region. Regional figures for 2013 to 2014 have been calculated from PCT data (using estimation where required).,,,,,,,,,,
[note 23],"Please note that system changes in 14 UTLAs in London earlier this year, as well as changes to the way multiple dose courses are calculated, mean that the coverage in London for some vaccines, particularly the pre-school (dTaP/IPV) booster and MMR2 is likely to be underestimated. Reported falls in coverage in these vaccines in the current year should not be used for local vaccination performance management or in isolation to direct public health action. Please see the data sources and methodology section for more information. Additionally, until data on children not registered with a GP can be validated, only children registered with a GP are included in the London-, England-, and UK-level figures. The affected UTLAs are Greenwich, Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, Lambeth, Lewisham, Southwark, Westminster, Bexley, Brent, Bromley, Ealing, Harrow, Hillingdon, and Hounslow. Coverage in these UTLAs will be higher than coverage measured when including the unregistered population. However, these coverage estimates will more closely reflect the true coverage in the population until the data on children not registered with a GP is fully validated.",,,,,,,,,,
